# AKMBookSwapRegistration
This project was developed to assist our schools' Honors Society's Project of the chapter Alpha Kappa Mu from Phi Theta Kappa. Our chapter has won the 2nd place of the Honors Project with the theme of "Sharing Economy" in Spring 2019.  More specifically, a book swap program. We have thought of allowing students to swap their textbooks with another student without having to buy one.  Or if they are willing to just donate their textbooks. So in order to keep the record, I have personally developed a Java program that allows the Chapter Officers to save the information to a database that would keep it in a server side. MySql was used in this project. However, due to privacy concern the database could not be uploaded.
